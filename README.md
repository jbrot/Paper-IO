# Paper-IO for Arduino

This is an implementation of the online game "Paper-IO" (found at http://paper-io.com/ ) for the PC in C++ with an optional Arduino UI.
It is made with permission.

## Building

The project is made using the Qt library. To build this project, install Qt 5.8, go to the root directory and type "qmake", and then "make".
There should now be a binary in your directory which you can either double click to run or launch from the command line.
